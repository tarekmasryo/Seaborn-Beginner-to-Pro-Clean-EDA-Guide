# 📊 Seaborn — Beginner-to-Pro 🎯

A practical, opinionated reference for **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/).  
We start from **beginner basics** → **intermediate customization** → **advanced patterns**.

---

## 🚀 Why this notebook?
- Clean, modular examples you can drop into real projects.  
- Short cells + clear plots = easy to follow.  
- Covers both **theory tips** (when to use what) and **hands-on code**.  
- Ends with a **compact EDA pipeline** you can reuse on Kaggle datasets.

## 📂 Datasets Used
All datasets are **built-in Seaborn samples**:
- `tips`  
- `penguins`  
- `flights`  
- `iris`  
- `titanic`  

No external downloads needed!

## 📖 Notebook Outline
1. **Setup & Theme Helpers** – reproducible, consistent visuals.  
2. **Beginner Plots** – histograms, KDE, countplot, bar vs. pointplot, scatter, line.  
3. **Intermediate Customization** – hue/style/size, facet grids, themes, matplotlib interop.  
4. **Advanced Patterns** – pairplot, jointplot, regression fits, ECDF, hexbin, correlation heatmaps.  
5. **Quick Gallery** – one-shot overview of multiple plots.  
6. **EDA Mini-Pipeline** – compact workflow on Titanic dataset (missingness, categorical vs numeric relations).  
7. **Best Practices & Pitfalls** – what to avoid + pro tips.  
8. **Cheat Sheet** – minimal examples with common gotchas.
